</p>

The English on establishing the Raj developed Waltair as a sister town of Vizag in the Madras Presidency. The city was the largest city at the time of Indian Independence and was divided into three manageable districts.

With just 25 years iunder the hood it changed from a sleepy town to bustling busines town. Vizag's dramatic transformation into a bustling business town without leaving its sheer natural beauty and calmness is true awsomeness that calls for huge applause.
