<h2>About Vizag Corporation</h2>

<p>The Vizag (Visakhapatnam) Municipality Was Set up as early as in <b>1858.</b> The Vizag (Visakhapatnam) Municipality Was Formed in order to fulfill the basic infrastructural needs of the people of the city and was converted into Municipal Corporation in <b>1979</b>.</p>

<p><b>Visakhapatnam</b>, popularly known as Vizag is a <b>multi-faceted city located in southeast India.</b> One of the largest ports in the country, Vizag is also known for its lush pristine beaches, gentle hillocks, and thriving flora and fauna. The promontory of Dolphin Hill has protected the city from natural disasters through time. The administrative capital of the Visakhapatnam district and the headquarters of the Eastern Naval Command is located in the city.</p>

<p><b>Visakhapatnam is one of the earliest municipalities along with Nellore, Kurnool, Vizianagaram and Bhimilipatnam.</b></p>

<p><b>Voluntary Municipal Association was set up in Visakhapatnam in the year 1858 under All India Act.</b></p>

<p><b>Act XVI of 1850. With the advent of Town Improvement Act of Madras (Act. 10 of 1865).</b></p>

<p>Substantial changes occurred and the Voluntary Municipal Association became a Municipality having a commission consisting of Officials and nominated mercantile community. Subsequently, vide <b>Madras District Municipalities Act 1884</b>, the Commission was designated as Council. The Constitutional and Administrative setup of the Vizag Municipality was set forth by the <b>Madras District Municipalities Act 1920 and the Amendment Act 1933 </b>remained unchanged without any significant changes until <b>1965</b> when the <b>Andhra Pradesh Legislature</b> passed the<b> Andhra Pradesh Municipalities Act 1965.</b></p>

<p>Since then the Vizag Municipality has grown in its Municipal limits due to incorporation of new areas and thus the need for conversion to Municipal Corporation occurred in the year <b>1979</b>.</p>

<p>In the year 1951 the population of the city was <b>1.08 lakhs</b> covering an area of <b>20.23 Sq.Km</b> and in the year 1971 the population rose to <b>3.52 lakhs</b> covering an area of <b>76.32 Sq.Km.</b> But over the next two decades, the population further increased to <b>7.5 lakhs</b> (1991) and the area of the Corporation also increased to 111.6 Sq.Km.</p>
<p>   A moderate estimate of the Corporations total population would be around<b> 10.5 lakhs by 2000.</b> However, the officials of Corporation have estimated it to be<b> 13.0 lakhs </b>due to rapid migration. Visakhapatnam is growing steadily, with a current population of <b>17.30 lakhs</b> in <b>2011</b>and projected to rise to around <b>20.99 lakhs by 2021.</b> The population growth rate in the city is inflated due to the high in-migration, owing to the multitude of economic opportunities that it offers. The city spreads over <b>544 Sq.Km..</b> It is the second largest city of Andhra Pradesh. Located favourably mid way between Kolkata and Chennai, along with the planned PCPIR, Vizag shall continue to gain prominence in the times to come.

          Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation is serving the estimated population of <b>12 lakhs</b> with a total number of <b>4,534 </b>officials and staff. The growth rate of population between <b>1981-91</b> is <b>47.39%</b> and the total annual revenue of the Corporation is about  <b>Rs.100 crores</b>.</p>
          <p>The Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation has been performing a variety of functions ever since it was established as a Voluntary Municipal Association as early as <b>1858.</b>
          The number and extent of functions have been on steady increase with the passage of time under different municipal laws. The municipal authority was started in the beginning with a very few functions namely streetlighting, markets, drainage and water supply. Now,after <b>142</b> years the number has gone up extensively covering a vast area of <b>111.60</b> squarekms in which <b>1.2 million</b> people live.</p>

          <p>Greater Visakha has finally arrived. The areas of the earstwhile Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation along with the Gajuwaka Municipality and 32 villages (includes few Panchayats) that will now be governed under Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation (GVMC). GVMC came into existance after the Government of Andhra Pradesh released the Government Order (GO) on<b> November 21, 2005.</b> The High Court has earlier dismissed some cases against the merger of some villages into the Greater Visakha. A subsequent notification has put the total number of wards in the region to <b>72</b>.</p>

          With the inclusion of the Gajuwaka Municipality, Greater Visakha will have a large industrial base. Major industries such as the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, the Bharat Heavy Plate and Vessels and the Hindustan Zinc, now a part of the Sterlite group will come under the limits of Greater Visakha.</p>
