    <h2>Right To Information</h2>
    <p>The Right to Information Act 2005 (RTI) is an Act of the Parliament of India, passed by the Central Government, in favor of the people of India. It implements freedom of information legislation in India on a national level "to provide for setting out the practical regime of right to information for citizens."</p>

    <p>The Act applies to all States and Union Territories of India, except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. Under the provisions of the Act, any citizen may request information from a "public authority" (a body of Government or "instrumentality of State") which is required to reply expeditiously or within thirty days.</p>

    <p>The Act also requires every public authority to computerize their records for wide dissemination and to proactively publish certain categories of information so that the citizens need minimum recourse to request for information formally.</p>

    <p>This law was passed by Parliament on 15 June 2005 and came fully into force on 13 October 2005. Information disclosure in India was hitherto restricted by the Official Secrets Act 1923 and various other special laws, which the new RTI Act now relaxes. Citizens are free to know from the Government authorities about any matter they wish to know.</p>

    <h1>Procedure For Obtaining Information</h1>
